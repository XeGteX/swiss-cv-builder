# The Eternal Loop ♾️

## Philosophy
The system is no longer static. It is a living organism that observes itself, diagnoses issues, and evolves without human intervention.

## The Cycle

1.  **Observe** 👁️
    - Agents scan the environment (Code, Metrics, Security).
    - Data is collected into analysis reports.

2.  **Diagnose** 🩺
    - Agents identify anomalies, inefficiencies, or risks.
    - Examples: "Error rate > 5%", "File size > 2KB", "Weak Secret".

3.  **Evolve** 🧬
    - Agents execute changes or propose plans.
    - Examples: "Clear Cache", "Refactor File", "Rotate Secret".

4.  **Rest** 🌙
    - The system sleeps to conserve resources before the next cycle.

## Agents

- **SecurityAgent**: The Immune System.
- **CodeRefactorAgent**: The Self-Repair Mechanism.
- **PerformanceAgent**: The Optimizer.
- **BusinessAgent**: The Strategist.

## Usage

Run the loop manually:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/eternal-loop.ts
```

In production, this runs as a cron job or a persistent background worker.
